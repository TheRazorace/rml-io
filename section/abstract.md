## Abstract {#abstract}

This document describes *Target*, 
a formal model and a common representation 
for specifying how a Knowledge Graph should be exported to a given target. 
Target reuses existing data access descriptions 
and is therefore not limited to a specific set of targets. 
The current document describes the Target concepts 
through definitions and examples.

The version of this document is *v1.0.0*.
